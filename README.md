# A fellow coder from Milan, Italy

## Here's what i'm into : 

- 📖 Learning Animation with React and React-Native (this is pain but they look good)
- 🔭 Looking to make my first npm package for styling in react-native
- 📖 Want to learn c++ and maybe some opengl (i'll have some time in the future, i hope)

# One thing i love and hate about coding : 

- ❤️ The feel of power it gives
- 💀 Time schedules are always a mess
